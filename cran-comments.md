## Resubmission

This is a resubmission following CRAN comments (an error on r-oldrel-macos-x86_64). Now all other distributions seem to work fine. Hopefully this is the the last correction for now.

* Required R >= 4.0.0
* Removed a version requirement for stats package
* Corrected

Thanks.

## Test environments
- R-hub windows-x86_64-devel (r-devel)
- R-hub ubuntu-gcc-release (r-release)
