# COINr

COINr is a comprehensive development and analysis package for composite indicators. It is currently under development.

Features will include:

* Unlimited aggregation groups and levels
* A range of imputation methods
* A range of normalisation methods
* Indicator statistics and visualisations
* Data treatment and comparison
* A range of aggregation methods
* Reweighting app based on correlations
* Automatic weight optimisation
* Full uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
* Report generation in R Markdown
* Export to Excel

And other features.

At the moment, many of these features have been written, either fully or in a limited form. I am gradually incorporating the functions into the package, which requires testing and alignment.

It is already possible to install a **very limited** version of this package from this repository, using:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("bluefoxr/COINr")
```

I should point out that this is an extremely early version of the package, with very little documentation, and only limited testing. A lot more should be added over early 2021, along with a detailed vignette. Stay tuned.

Documentation for the package, which is also currently just a skeleton outline, is available here: https://bluefoxr.github.io/COINrDoc/
