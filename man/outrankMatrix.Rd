\title{Outranking matrix}
\usage{
outrankMatrix(ind_data, w = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ind_data}{A data frame or matrix of indicator data, with observations as rows and indicators
as columns. No other columns should be present (e.g. label columns).}

\item{w}{A vector of weights, which should have length equal to \code{ncol(ind_data)}. Weights are relative
and will be re-scaled to sum to 1. If \code{w} is not specified, defaults to equal weights.}
}
\value{
Outranking matrix
}
\description{
Constructs an outranking matrix based on a data frame of indicator data and corresponding weights. This function is used inside
\code{\link[=aggregate]{aggregate()}}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# get a sample of a few indicators
ind_data <- ASEMIndData[12:16]
# calculate outranking matrix
outrankMatrix(ind_data)}
