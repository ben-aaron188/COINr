\description{
A shortcut function to add and remove indicators. This will make the relevant changes
and recalculate the index if asked. Adding and removing is done relative to the current set of
indicators used in calculating the index results. Any indicators that are added must of course be
present in the original \code{iData} and \code{iMeta} that were input to \code{new_coin()}.
