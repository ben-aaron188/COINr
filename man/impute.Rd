\usage{
impute(
  COIN,
  imtype = NULL,
  dset = NULL,
  groupvar = NULL,
  EMaglev = NULL,
  out2 = "COIN"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{COIN}{A COIN or a data frame}

\item{imtype}{The type of imputation method. Either "agg_mean" (the mean of normalised indicators inside the aggregation group),
"agg_median" (the median of normalised indicators inside the aggregation group),
"ind_mean" (the mean of all the other units in the indicator),
"ind_median" (the median of all the other units in the indicator),
"indgroup_mean" (the mean of all the other units in the indicator, in the same group),
"indgroup_median" (the median of all the other units in the indicator, in the same group),
"EM" (expectation maximisation algorithm via AMELIA package, currently without bootstrapping)
"none" (no imputation, returns original data set)}

\item{dset}{The data set in .$Data to impute}

\item{groupvar}{The name of the column to use for by-group imputation. Only applies when imtype is set to a group option.}

\item{EMaglev}{The aggregation level to use if imtype = "EM".}

\item{out2}{Where to output the results. If "COIN" (default for COIN input), appends to updated COIN,
otherwise if "df" outputs to data frame.}
}
\value{
A dataframe of normalised indicators.
}

Imputation of data sets using a variety of methods.
